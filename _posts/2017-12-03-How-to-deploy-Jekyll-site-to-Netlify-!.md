title: How to deploy Jekyll site to Netlify ?
---
Hey there, this post is all about deployment of a static site generated by jekyll to netlify !
In this post, im assuming you are aware of what Github and Jekyll does and you will need a Github account to get started . if you don't have a Github account then create it [here](//github.com). However , you can use [gitlab](//gitlab.com) or [bitbucket](//bitbucket.com) as an alternative to Github.<br />
<br />I'm also assuming that you are aware of static sites and generators of such sites , here is a [list](//staticgen.com). However Jekyll is most popular and typically used for blogs and project pages. <br />
There are so many free themes available for Jekyll, fork them  and setup accordingly. Every theme has it's guide to getting started either in <code>Readme.md</code> or in </code>_posts</code> folder.<br />by the way, its easy to setup without any guide , you just need to edit a file (<code>_config.yml</code>) with extension <code>.yml</code> in the repository. Don't edit everything if you don't have knowledge which one you are editing. You can edit basic things like title,url,social details and permalink. <br />
[Browse free themes at Jekyllrc](//themes.jekyllrc.org)<br />
We will be using a Jekyll site with a random theme and repository at Github.
