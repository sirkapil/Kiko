title: How to deploy Jekyll site to Netlify ?
---
Hey there, this post is all about deployment of a static site generated by jekyll to netlify !
In this post, im assuming you are aware of what Github and Jekyll does and you will need a Github account to get started . if you don't have a Github account then create it [here](//github.com). However , you can use [gitlab](//gitlab.com) or [bitbucket](//bitbucket.com) as an alternative to Github.
<br />I'm also assuming that you are aware of static sites and generators of such sites , here is a [list](//staticgen.com). However Jekyll is most popular and typically used for blogs and project pages. <br />There are so many free themes available for Jekyll, fork them  and setup accordingly. Everyone requires to edit a file with extension <code>yml</code> named <code>_config.yml</code> [Browse Themes](//themes.jekyllrc.io)
We will be using a Jekyll site with a random theme and repository at Github.
