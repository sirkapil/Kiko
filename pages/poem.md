i will find hope in anything
if it means there is a chance
you will love me
i will scrape every bit of hope 
from the tunnels of our conversation 
in order to sellotape a crack in my heart,
i want to believe in the chance
you will love me more than him,
but it is hard to be someone’s world
when they are looking for a country,
he is a town 
and i am the universe 
however in your eyes,
he is simply 
more 
than i could 
ever be.
