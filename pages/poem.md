I still can recall a quote from a novel i too had a love story by ravinder singh. NOT everyone in this world has the fate to cherish the fullest form of love. some are born ,just to experience the abbreviation of it. so was me, just experienced love’s abbreviation only. The pain injuries of this broken heart may heal with time But marks will always remain restless on my comfortable bed and i can’t forget that past. The present! It’s so different from the past. The past! It will never come back. Never ever! 





i will find hope in anything
if it means there is a chance
you will love me
i will scrape every bit of hope 
from the tunnels of our conversation 
in order to sellotape a crack in my heart,
i want to believe in the chance
you will love me more than him,
but it is hard to be someone’s world
when they are looking for a country,
he is a town 
and i am the universe 
however in your eyes,
he is simply 
more 
than i could 
ever be.

- Alisa



I'm something that
you')) regrer losing.
i can promisw that much.
