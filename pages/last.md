My heart shatters while writing this, but i have to accept that-

**Just like star-crossed lovers, 
We cannot be together.**

Thank u for giving me some of the most beautiful memories of my life.

You took a tough decision. I know that you do not take any decision lightly so before taking this decision, you would have thought about it a lot. I will respect ur decision. I can understand that you dont have feelings for me and dont want us to be together. It's okay ! 

The last thing , i can say to you is : Always keep smiling, you are precious to me. Even, Uniform mai bhi khush rehna.

>**Without an explanation,
I must leave.
Without another word,
I must live on my life
Without you,**

I wish that you'll find your true love soon. I will always remember you with love.

Good Bye !<br>
My dearest love.
