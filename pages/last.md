I really dont know what to say to you and what not ? Even, My heart beats at 300kmph while writing all this, but i have to accept that-

**Just like star-crossed lovers, 
We cannot be together.**

Thanku for giving me some of the most beautiful memories of my life. I will always remember them with love.

You took a tough decision. I know that you do not take any decision lightly so before taking this decision, you would have thought about it a lot. I will respect ur decision. I can understand that you dont have feelings for me and dont want us to be together. It's okay ! 

The last thing , i can say to you is : Always keep smiling, you are precious to me. Even, Uniform mai bhi khush rehna. Best wishes for serving in uniform !

I wish that you'll find your true love soon.

I don't have much to say now, without another word, i must leave. We aren't supposed to meet again in life. Abhi apni aankhe band krna..close, bilkul close and vaise hee bye bolna jaise hum last time metro mai mile the, aise hee muskrate hue.

Good Bye !<br>
My dearest love.
