I really dont know what to say to you and what not ? Even, My heart beats at 300kmph while writing all this, but i have to accept that-

**Just like star-crossed lovers, 
We cannot be together.**

Thanku for giving me some of the most beautiful memories of my life. I will always remember them with love.

You took a tough decision. I know that you do not take any decision lightly so before taking this decision, you would have thought about it a lot. I will respect ur decision. I can understand that you dont have feelings for me and dont want us to be together. It's okay ! 

The last thing , i can say to you is : Always keep smiling, you are precious to me. Even, Uniform mai bhi khush rehna. Best wishes for serving in uniform !

I wish that you'll find your true love soon.

Good Bye !<br>
My dearest love.
