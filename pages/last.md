My heart shatters while writing this, but i have to accept that-

**Just like star-crossed lovers, 
We cannot be together.**

Thank u for giving me some of the most beautiful memories of my life.

I know that you do not take any decision lightly so before taking this decision, you would have thought about it a lot. I will respect ur decision. I can understand that you dont have feelings for me and want us to be seperated. It's okay !  it will be very hard for me to stay away from you , but it will be even more hard for me being only friend with you forever. 

+ You understand me so well, just like you can read my mind.
+ I learn a lot from you.
+ Every time I hear a romantic song,<br>
It reminds me of you,<br>
+ My life is beautiful when you're with me. I feel lucky and every second become beautiful for me.
+ You make me happy. I laugh even on little things. I laughed out that whole next day when you gave that diwali night gift, Diwali gift mai unblock kon deta hai ? Seriously, Haha😆. uss din pyar bhi bahut aaya aur hasi bhi.
+ You've got nice lips. Always keep smile on them. you must know that, every time you smile, i melt😍

Always keep smiling. Even, Hostel mai bhi khush rehna. I wish, you never have to miss me and you forget me soon.
If somehow, you miss me, just close your eyes and think about all this unconditional and unrequited love. I'll be there, right by your side. Love you always !

>**Without an explanation,
I must leave.
Without another word,
I must live on my life
Without you,**

I wish that you'll find your true love soon.

Good Bye !<br>
My dearest love.
