The heart shatters while writing this, but i have to accept that -

**Just like star-crossed lovers, 
We cannot be together.**

Thank u for giving me some of the most beautiful memories of my life.

I know that you do not take any decision lightly so before taking this decision, you would have thought about it a lot. I will respect ur decision. I can understand that you dont have feelings for me and want us to be seperated. It's okay !  it will be very hard for me to stay away from you , but it will be even more hard for me being only friend with you forever. I think it will be harder to not be in touch because I care a lot about you and know that u care also.

Every time I hear a romantic song,
It reminds me of you,
Every time I wake up,
I think about you
Every time I daydream,
I imagine our future

Call me a helpless romantic,
but I lived desperately for you

So, whenever you feel lonely, just close your eyes and think about all this unconditional and unrequited love. I'll be there, right by your side. Love you always !

>**Without an explanation,
I must leave
Without another word,
I must live on
Without you,**

I wish that you'll find your true love soon.

Good bye, My dearest love.
