I hope you never had to open this letter. I never want you to feel lonely. never ever. I may be thousands of miles away from you but my heart is always with you, it goes wherever you go.


Sometimes there are certain things you need to hear, to help get through. Here are some things that helped me and that I hope help you.

You are not alone.

I know everything seems to be telling you and showing you that you are, but you're not. You might just have to open your eyes a little wider and look around.

Don't hide your emotions.

Everyone gets sad and needs help getting back on their feet sometimes, it's just a part of life. If you're having a bad day, show it! If you need to cry, then cry with pride! Never be ashamed of how you feel.

Unfortunately, most people aren't mind-readers.

Yes, in life we have some people that can read us better than their favorite books, but sometimes they have an off day. If something is wrong, tell someone. I promise there is someone out there who cares enough to listen.


Believe in quality not in quantity
