I hope you never had to open this letter. I never want you to feel alone. **Never ever.**

First thing you should know is that : 

+ **You are not alone.**
(Abhi Mai Hu Naa ❤)

> I'm forever with you. I may be thousands of miles away from you but my heart ❤ is always with you, it goes wherever you go. So, Don't feel alone.  No matter how bad situation is, I'll be always with you. I can't solve all of your problems but rest assured that I'll be always there with you just like a shadow. 

+**Look Around**

> Always remember that there are few persons who always care for you and thier happiness is directly attached to you. no matter where you go, your family members will be always with you. Hug them tight and say thank you to the god that you're blessed to have them in ur life. 

+ **Don't hide your emotions**

> If you're having a bad day, show it !  If you need to cry, then cry with pride ! Never be ashamed of how you feel. They are just parts of life, bad days as well as good days. If something is hurting you then discuss. However, If you want to , then you can call me and say all those things hurting you. If some-thing is wrong, you can tell me. You are always precious to me and  I promise that I'll always care enough to listen to you and at anytime. Give me a call. Alright!
