I hope you never had to open this letter. I never want you to feel lonely. never ever. 

Sometimes there are certain things you need to hear, to help get through. Here are some things that helped me and that I hope help you.

**You are not alone.**

> I'm forever with you. I may be thousands of miles away from you but my heart is always with you, it goes wherever you go. However, If you want to , then you can call me and unload all those things hurting you. If something is wrong, you can tell me.  I promise that I'll always care enough to listen to you anytime.

> I know everything seems to be telling you and showing you that you are, but you're not. You might just have to open your eyes a little wider and look around.

**Don't hide your emotions.**

> If you're having a bad day, show it!  If you need to cry, then cry with pride ! Never be ashamed of how you feel. It's just a part of life.

**Unfortunately, most people aren't mind-readers. **

> Yes, in life we have some people who can read us better than their favorite books, but sometimes they have an off day.

**Believe in quality not in quantity**

> Do you know why we feel alone ? Because the one we want to care for


**Learn to enjoy your own company**
