I hope you never had to open this letter. I never want you to feel lonely. **Never ever.**

Umm.. You feeling lonely ? Really ?
First thing you should know is that : 

+ **You are not alone.**

> I'm forever with you. I may be thousands of miles away from you but my heart is always with you, it goes wherever you go. However, If you want to , then you can call me and say all those things hurting you. If some-thing is wrong, you can tell me.  I promise that I'll always care enough to listen to you and anytime.

Alright !
