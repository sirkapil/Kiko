I hope you never had to open this letter. I never want you to feel alone. **Never ever.**

Umm.. You feeling lonely ? Really ?
First thing you should know is that : 

+ **You are not alone.**

> I'm forever with you. I may be thousands of miles away from you but my heart ‚ù§ is always with you, it goes wherever you go. So, Don't feel alone. 


+ **Don't hide your emotions**

> If you're having a bad day, show it !  If you need to cry, then cry with pride ! Never be ashamed of how you feel. They are just parts of life, bad days as well as good days. If something is hurting you then discuss. However, If you want to , then you can call me and say all those things hurting you. If some-thing is wrong, you can tell me.  I promise that I'll always care enough to listen to you and at anytime.

Alright !

(Abhi Main Hun ‚ù§)
