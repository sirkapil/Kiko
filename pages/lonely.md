 Unfortunately, most people aren't mind-readers. Yes, in life we have some people who can understand us better, but sometimes they can't. So, you have to discuss with them. 



Even if you don't want, then you just have to open your eyes a little wider and look around , may be someone is there. You aren't alone at all.

+ **Believe in quality not in quantity** 

If you have a gang of true friends then you aren't alone. You need not to have hundreds of friends, just one or two friends who cares for you, understands you and never let you feel alone. So, choose better friends with heart without judging and comparing them. Most often, you'll feel lonely even being surrounded by so many people that's because the one we want to care for us, doesn't actually do. 


+ **Learn to enjoy your own company**

No one is permanent in this life. Eventually everyone has to go from life. Your boyfriend will be no longer yours , he'll look for another girl while being away from you. Your friends will be no longer your friend. It's only you who has to walk on this track of your life. So, learn to enjoy your own company.
