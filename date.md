+ I'm an average boy with an average complexion and look. So, no girls would snatch me from you.

+ Let's date beside an ocean with beer. So, we can share things without hesitation. Alcohol makes us speak.

+ I don't know much cooking. I can cook fried rice. But, we can spend our time in kitchen. You can be my mentor in cooking. If you don't know cooking let's open YouTube and learn cooking online. :D

+ I'm not a great singer, but I have a soothing voice. I can sing lullaby for you.

+ I'm 5′11″. So, you can hug me perfectly if you are below 5′5". If you are  above 6' then remove your heel sandals :D

+ I'm not too intelligent, but I have qualified few competitive exams, eg. CSIR-JRF, GATE , IIT-JAM in very first attempt and I have basic common sense.

+ I don't try to impress you when we are on date. If I try to impress you, I will definitely lose my originality. So I will be myself. You can feel the rawness without any sugar-coated behaviour.

+ I don't have many friends. So, I can give a lot of time to you.

+ If I don't like anything about you I will say it on your face and I expect the same thing from you. Let's be transparent like water with our opinions/ feedbacks. Let's be pure like milk with our behaviour.

+ I like to hug you from behind and kiss on your cheeks.

+ I prefer kissing on your forehead than on your lips on our first date, but be ready to get a mark of love bite on your lips if we meet second time.

+ I love classic comedy and romantic movies over action movies. I love peace.

+ I can treat you like an angel for a moment and the very next moment I never give a f**k about you. So, be ready to tolerate my fickle mindedness.

+ Let's prepare a mug of coffee and start the conversation in balcony instead of dating in mall or pub's.

+ I have a dual/ split personality. A social, fun side and an evil, moody side. So, you can enjoy dating 2 persons in me.

+ I prefer “Ladies first” rule, that doesn't make me gentleman. It's just because I can stare you from behind for a long time. Men will be men :D

+ I love reading books and watching movies. So, obviously I have a great content in my mind to entertain you.

+ I have a dirty sense of humour. So, you will not get bored.

+ I'm very practical, naughtiest and mischievous person.

+ I have the patience to listen to your pain.

+ I'm quite popular on Quora. So, you may get dating popular Quoran feel. You can write the answer to “ How was your experience dating popular Quora writer Rakshith Akira? ❤”

+ I'm good at kissing. So, yeah I can make you go crazy.

+ I don't have 6 packs. I don't like gym much.

+ I'm a mature person. So, I can tolerate your immature behaviour, but sometimes i can act like a child in front of you.

+ I'm good at motivating people. So, you can have a motivational factor with you.

+ I'm very sensitive and caring kind of personality.

+ I'm humble and down to earth fellow.

+ I forgive soon and forget very soon.

+ I love traditional girl for dating over modern torn jeans girl.

+ I look innocent but I have a devil mind.

+ If I see your bra strips outside of your dress, I will text you saying that instead of telling you in public, but in private, sorry I can't help you out ;)

+ I'm not a photogenic. So, we can take pics for memories instead of taking pics to post it on Quora or Facebook.

+ I'm not rich, but I can take you to an good restaurant or a good sensational movie.

+ I'm not at all interested in cricket or football. So, you can get hold on TV remote.

+ There is an innocent kid, arrogant warrior, blunt writer and dirty humourous fellow in me.

+ I'm a retro type outdated fashion fellow

+ I'm very short tempered. So, you have to take care of my anger. But I cool down soon.

+ Let's go on a unplanned destination. It will be fun. Planning kills enthusiasm

+ I'm not an MBA, but I know how to market myself.

+ I'm struggling to be rich and popular. So, you can see the glimpse of future conquerer in me
