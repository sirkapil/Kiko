If someday you start liking me or want to give a chance to our relationship. Then, We can surely go out for a date. But, before all that, I want you to know a few things about me.

---

+ I'm straight forward and trustworthy. So, we can share secrets without hesitation.
+ I don't know much cooking. I can cook fried rice and a few things. But, we can spend our time in kitchen. We can be each other's mentor in cooking. You don't know cooking. So, We can open YouTube and learn cooking online together. :D
+ I'm not a great singer, but I have a few friends with soothing voice. Even, I can sing for you.
+ I'm 5‚Ä≤10‚Ä≥. So, you can hug me perfectly as you are around 5‚Ä≤6". I'll not mind even If you were taller then you can remove your heel sandals :D
+ I'm not too intelligent, but I have qualified a few tough competitive exams, in very first attempt and I have basic common sense too.
+ I don't try to impress you when we are on date. If I try to impress you, I will definitely lose my originality. So I will be myself. You can feel the rawness without any sugar-coated behaviour.
+ I don't have many friends. So, I can give a lot of time to you.
+ If I don't like anything about you, I can say it on your face and I expect the same thing from you. Let's be transparent like water with our opinions/ feedbacks.
+ I like to hug you from behind and kiss on your cheeks.
+ I prefer kissing on your forehead than on your lips on our first date, but be ready to get a mark of love bite on your lips if we meet second time.
+ I love classic comedy and romantic movies over action movies. I love peace.
+ Mostly, I use "F" words. But, It doesn't mean that I don't have manners or I don't respect others.
+ I can treat you like an angel for a moment and the very next moment I never give a f**k about you. So, be ready to tolerate my fickle mindedness.
+ I have a dual/ split personality. A social, funny side and an evil, silent, moody side. So, you can enjoy dating 2 persons in me.
+ I prefer ‚ÄúLadies first‚Äù rule, that doesn't make me gentleman. It's just because I can stare you from behind for a long time. Men will be men :D
+ I love reading books and watching movies. So, obviously I have a great content in my mind to entertain you.
+ I have a dirty sense of humour. So, you will not get bored.
+ I have the patience to listen to your pain.
+ I have never kissed any girl. But, yeah I can make you go crazy
+ I don't have 6 packs. I don't like gym much.
+ I'm a mature person. So, I can tolerate your immature behaviour, but sometimes i can act like a child in front of you.
+ There is an innocent kid, arrogant warrior, blunt writer and dirty humourous fellow in me.
+ I'm a retro type outdated fashion fellow. Usually, can be seen in formals. But, We can go for shopping of updated fashionable things. 
+ I'm very short tempered. So, you have to take care of my anger. But, I cool down very soon.
+ I'm not your ex. So, Don't expect his each and every quality in me. But, you can frankly tell me all those things, i should work on.
+ I'm an average boy with an average complexion and look. So, no girls would snatch me from you.
+ I'm good at motivating people. So, you can have a motivational factor with you. 
+ I'm very sensitive and caring kind of personality.
+ I'm humble and down to earth fellow.
+ I forgive soon and forget very soon.
+ I love traditional girl for dating over modern torn jeans girl.
+ I look innocent but I have a devil mind. 
+ If I see your bra strips outside of your dress, I will text you saying that instead of telling you in public, but in private, sorry I can't help you out ;)
+ I'm not a photogenic. So, we can take pics for memories instead of taking pics to post it on Instagram or Facebook.
+ I'm not very rich (ambani ki aulad type üòÇ) but I can take you to a good restaurant or a good sensational movie.
+ I'm interested in kabbadi, cricket and football. But, you can get hold on TV remote.
+ We can plan to go on a unplanned destination on weekends. It will be fun. Planning kills enthusiasm.
+ I'm struggling to be popular. So, you can see the glimpse of future conquerer in me.

So, Let's meet and start the conversation with a mug of coffee !
