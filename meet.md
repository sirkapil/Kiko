As we're not together. I don't know,  when will that day come ? After a month, year or decade (too long, lol😆)? But, I'm sure that day will surely come. One morning , I'll wake up just to meet you again. You'll gotta see my face and I'll gotta see your face that day. I'm damn sure that We'll surely have marvelous time together that day.

We'll eat so much , party together. No need to bring home made food. 

I know people change with time, we'll see so many changes in each other, surly few changes that we never expected. As we were close friends , each is gonna miss another. (I'm missing you badly and surely you'll be missing me little bit). 

But I'll not be enough changed to admit that i missed you or i still love you. Even if i did, i know that you will know the truth by just looking into my eyes , after all you have an special ability to read my mind just looking into my eyes. Anyways, As I'll hug you into my arms, you'll listen to my heartbeats and get to know that it is still beating for someone named chamki.

Maybe one day we’ll meet again when we’re different people.

Maybe then we’ll be better for each other. 

Waiting for that one day !

❤😘❤
